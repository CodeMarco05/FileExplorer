# ART Prefix Search Time Analysis

Let's analyze your ART v4/v5 **prefix search time complexity** from your benchmark data and compare it to typical ART implementations.

## 1. **Your Benchmark Data (Average Search Time)**

| Number of Paths | Avg Search Time (Âµs) |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| 10              | 1.641                |
| 100             | 9.655                |
| 1,000           | 19.647               |
| 10,000          | 21.866               |
| 171,113         | 22.980               |

## 2. **Empirical Complexity Estimation**

### **Logarithmic Transformation**

Letâ€™s examine how the search time scales as the dataset grows:

- 10 â†’ 100: â€ƒ**10Ã—** more paths â†’ **5.9Ã—** more time  
- 100 â†’ 1,000: â€ƒ**10Ã—** more paths â†’ **2.0Ã—** more time  
- 1,000 â†’ 10,000: â€ƒ**10Ã—** more paths â†’ **1.1Ã—** more time  
- 10,000 â†’ 171,113: â€ƒ**17Ã—** more paths â†’ **1.05Ã—** more time

ðŸ‘‰ The growth is clearly **sub-linear** and rapidly flattening.

### **Fitting to Complexity Curves**

#### **Linear O(n):**  
A 10Ã— increase in input would yield a 10Ã— increase in time. Your data scales **far better**.

#### **Log-linear O(n log n):**  
Your growth is **still below** this.

#### **Logarithmic O(log n):**  
A 10Ã— input increase â†’ time grows by ~1.3Ã—. Your scaling is **even better than logarithmic** between larger steps.

## 3. **Curve Fit and Practical Complexity**

- From **10 to 10,000 paths**: 1,000Ã— more data â†’ **only ~13Ã—** more time.
- From **10,000 to 171,113 paths**: 17Ã— more data â†’ **only ~1.05Ã—** more time.

This suggests the implementation hits **memory/cache-optimized behavior** as dataset grows.

### **Empirical Complexity:**  
Likely **O(log n)** or even better (e.g., **O(n^a)** with a â‰ª 1).

## 4. **Comparison to Typical ART Implementations**

### **Theoretical complexity of ART**  
- **Exact match:** O(k)  
- **Prefix search:** O(k + m), where  
  - *k* = prefix length  
  - *m* = number of matches  

### **Your results:**  
- Search times are **faster than O(n log n)**, clearly **sub-linear**.  
- **Match or outperform** standard ART behavior.  
- Your prefix search stays efficient even at large scales (>170k paths).

## 5. **Summary Table**

| Implementation         | Theoretical Prefix Search | Practical Scaling | Your Data      |
|------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Linear scan            | O(n)                      | Linear            | Much slower    |
| Naive trie             | O(k + m)                  | Sub-linear        | Faster         |
| Typical ART            | O(k + m)                  | Sub-linear        | Similar        |
| **Your ART v4/v5**     | **O(k + m)**              | **Sub-linear**    | **Excellent**  |

## 6. **Conclusion**

- **Your ART prefix search is highly optimized.**
- Scaling is **significantly better** than linear and **better than log-linear**.
- The near-constant runtime at larger sizes suggests excellent use of ARTâ€™s structure and memory layout.
- Your implementation is among the **best-case practical performances** for in-memory prefix search.
